browser fetches the form-element from the page, and registers an event handler to handle the form submit event
the event handler immediately calls the method e.preventDefault() to prevent the default handling of form submit
the event handler creates a new note, adds it to the notes list, rerenders the note list on the page and sends the new note to the server
the new note is displayed
end note
